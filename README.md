Q1- What is Node JS ? 
Node.js is an open source server environment Node.js is free Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.) Node.js uses JavaScript on the server
Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

Q2- What is Routing in nodeJS?

Routing refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing. We define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. there are five different types of middleware: 3rd Party, Router, Application, Error-handling, and Built-in. Scott explains a few of these types and shares a few code examples of their use.

Q3- What is middleware? The middleware in node. js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object, responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle. there are five different types of middleware: 3rd Party, Router, Application, Error-handling, and Built-in. Scott explains a few of these types and shares a few code examples of their use.

Q4-What is Express is used for? Express JS is a Node.js framework designed to build API's web applications cross-platform mobile apps quickly and make node js easy. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes. Express was created to make APIs and web applications with ease, It saves a lot of coding time almost by half and still makes web and mobile applications are efficient. Another reason for using express is that it is written in javascript as javascript is an easy language even if you don't have a previous knowledge of any language. Express lets so many new developers enter the field of web development. Express provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP verb ( GET , POST , SET , etc.) and URL pattern ("Route"), and methods to specify what template ("view") engine is used, where template files are located, and what template to use to render a response.

Q5-what is module in node js? Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application. Each module in Node. js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope. The module system is built around the require function. This function is used to load a module and get access to its contents. require is a global variable provided to all your Node. js scripts, so you can use it anywhere you like.

Node. js has two module systems: CommonJS modules and ECMAScript modules.
